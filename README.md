# Fibonacci Sequence

## Description
The Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence is calculated using this script. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the following number is the sum of the two numbers before it. The sequence goes on forever:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233......

## Usage
•	Run the fibonacci.py file to execute this program. You will be asked to input the Nth Fibonacci number to be calculated. To exit, enter a valid number (such as 5, 50, 100, or 9999) or press the 'Q' key.
•	If you input a number larger than or equal to 10000, the application will prompt you to confirm that you wish to proceed.

## Special cases
•	If you input 1, the application will display '0' and inform you that the first Fibonacci number is 0.
•	If you input 2, the software will output '0, 1' and notify you that the Fibonacci number for the second position is 1.

## Instructions:
To run the program, follow these steps:
1.	If you haven't already, download and install Python 3 on your computer.
2.	Launch a command prompt or terminal window and browse to the program's installation location.
3.	To start the program, type python3 fibonacci.py.
4.	Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the Nth Fibonacci number to compute, or press 'Q' to exit the program.

## Additional points:
•	If the user inputs a huge number, the application shows a caution notice since computing such a figure can take some time.
•	The application handles unusual situations in which the user enters 1 or 2.
•	By default, the software displays the first two Fibonacci numbers.
•	A while loop is used in the software to compute the Nth Fibonacci number and shift the last two integers in the sequence.

## Conclusion:
This Python code shows how to compute the Nth Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci sequence in a simple yet beautiful way. You can simply run the program and verify its operation with different input values by following the steps above. The application also offers several extra features that make it more user-friendly and efficient.
